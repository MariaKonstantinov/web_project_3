                            shores of the Dnipro river. Of course, no one in their right mind would swim in the river,
                            unless they grew up here, in which case they've probably tried it at some point. Summers are
                            hot here, and the winters are drafty, but the fall and the spring are are absolutely
                            amazing.</p>
                        <p class="place__paragraph">The city itself is a mix of pre-revolution, post-war and soviet
                            architecture, all of it sprinkled with modified balconies. If you're on the right bank of
                            the Dnipro, the landscape is difficult to traverse for people on bikes and those wearing
                            heels. The left bank is considered far less interesting and prestigious though, even by
                            people who live on the far outskirts of the right one.</p>

                            rock that juts
                            out into the sea. It is thought to have been built by Llewelyn the Great in the 13th
                            century. Some 900 years
                            later, the self-styled Pearl of Wales on the Shores of Snowdonia has become a popular
                            tourist destination
                            during the summer months.</p>
                        <p class="place__paragraph">A short walk down the road from the castle, you can enjoy the
                            world's best ice cream
                            at Cadwalader's, whose secret ingredient is rumored to be locally sourced seaweed. Another
                            claim to fame is
                            the fact that Cricieth won the Wales in Bloom award for five years in a row for its
                            spectacular floral
                            displays around town. It was also home to David Lloyd George, the only Welshman ever to hold
                            the office of
                            Prime Minister of the UK.</p>

                            town is surrounded by beautiful forests and countryside. It's known as the arts and crafts
                            capital of the state, and visitors will find plenty of shopping opportunities: shops with
                            handmade jewelry, candles, wood items, galleries, glass studios, and more. The town holds a
                            yearly festival celebrating "spoonbread", a local dish made with cornbread and served with a
                            wooden spoon.</p>
                        <p class="place__paragraph">However, it's probably known best for the local college. Berea
                            College was founded in 1855 and was the first college in the south to be racially
                            integrated, as well as the first to be coeducational. Somewhat uniquely, it charges no
                            tuition â€” every student receives a full-tuition scholarship.</p>

                            Muramvya was the royal capital and in 2007, because of its cultural and natural landscape,
                            it was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List. It is located in the center of
                            Burundi, between the country's political and economic capitals.</p>

                            think you're in heaven. At 2,665 meters (8,743 ft) above sea level, Mount Teza is one of the
                            coldest places in the province. But that cool breeze allows for one of the largest
                            plantations of tea and coffee in the country, which make up the bulk of Burundi's exports.

                            well known for its unique architecture which consists of many different historic buildings
                            such as Saint Basil's Cathedral with its brightly coloured domes. With over 40 percent of
                            its territory covered by greenery, it is one of the greenest capitals and major cities in
                            Europe and the world, having the largest forest in an urban area within its borders-more
                            than any other major city even before its expansion in 2012. In the course of its history
                            the city has served as the capital of a progression of states, from the medieval Grand Duchy
                            of Moscow and the subsequent Tsardom of Russia to the Soviet Union.</p>
